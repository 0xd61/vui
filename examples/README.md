# Examples

## Control Gallery

Right now this is the only example and has only been test running on Linux. It requires you have SDL2 installed on the system and have a working OpenGL setup.
Work is being done to make this example better and be tested on other platforms.

To compile and run, execute the following command:
```
./run.sh ctrl_gallery
```
